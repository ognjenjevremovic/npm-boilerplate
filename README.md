# npm module boilerplate

***npm module boilerplate (aka, starter project)*** - for easing myself going through the pain of setting up the project from scratch each and every time I want to work on an [Node](http://www.node.js) module and prepeare a release for the [npm](http://npmjs.org) registry.
It has a *little bit* opinionated file structure, which is reasonable as it is primarily used by me and for the modules that I work on, though you're free to use it for your own project - *tweak it, break it, claim it*.

### More about the npm module development
All the modules I produce are freely available for you to use.
They can be found on the [npm registry, under my name](https://www.npmjs.com/~ognjen.jevremovic).

Because of the ease of use of all the modules I produce, I conveniently prefix them with ***pretty-easy***.
You can found a list of all the *pretty-easy* modules [here](https://www.npmjs.com/~ognjen.jevremovic).

I develop them using **TypeScript** and all the test coverages are done using **TypeScript** and **Mocha** library alongside the Node's [**Assertion**](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v6.x/docs/api/assert.html) module.
There are also a lot of Node **scripts** defined (think of them as *bash/shell commands*) to make the process much faster and more ***automagical***.
